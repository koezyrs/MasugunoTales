## Masuguno Tales
A 2D ORPG free-to-play that was created using C++/SDL2 and SQL.

### About Masuguno
Masuguno was developed by KoeZyrs in 2023. This is my first game btw :D

### How to use
This was not designed to be an open-source project. The source is being released for educational purposes. I would not suggest using this in a production game.

The repository also doesn't include any of the non-code assets used by the game. As such, you'll need to use your own instead.

*Edit 1: If this repo got 500 stars. I will public the non-code assets.

### How to play
Download the lastest release version and you are good to go.
